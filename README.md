## Project email composer improvements

- extend tests, add more tests jest, rtl;
- add airbnb linter, prettier;
- instead of png, use svg for the icons.

## UI/UX improvements

- instead of horizontal scrolling in input field I would maybe rather use multiline (maybe textarea rather than input field) field and add additional values;
- for search I would use instead of "dummy" search -- Algolia, or Elastic Search, you also gain experience of analytics with it, etc.
